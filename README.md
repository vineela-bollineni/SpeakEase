## 📌 Problem Statement

In many educational institutions, students face daily issues related to classrooms, hostels, washrooms, food, and infrastructure. However, due to the absence of a proper communication channel, many issues remain unresolved.

Students often hesitate to approach faculty directly or are unsure whom to contact, leading to:
- Delayed issue resolution
